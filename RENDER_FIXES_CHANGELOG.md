# ðŸ”§ Render Deployment Fixes - Changelog

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **502 Bad Gateway Error** âœ…
**Problem:** Application was hardcoded to bind to port 8000, but Render uses dynamic PORT environment variable.

**Solution:**
- Updated `gunicorn.conf.py` to read `PORT` environment variable
- Configured dynamic port binding: `bind = f"0.0.0.0:{os.getenv('PORT', '8000')}"`
- Added logging to show which port is being used

### 2. **Health Check Validation Error** âœ…
**Problem:** Health endpoint was returning 500 errors due to Pydantic validation failures.

**Solution:**
- Fixed `HealthResponse` model to accept mixed types in `model_info`
- Added proper serialization logic in health check endpoint
- Now handles `bool`, `str`, and `list` types properly

### 3. **Dockerfile Optimization** âœ…
**Problem:** Dockerfile was trying to copy credential files that don't exist in cloud environment.

**Solution:**
- Removed hardcoded credential file copying
- Updated health check to use dynamic PORT environment variable
- Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` for proper credential loading

### 4. **Worker Configuration for Cloud** âœ…
**Problem:** Too many workers could cause memory issues on Render's limited resources.

**Solution:**
- Added cloud-aware worker configuration
- Reduced worker count for production environments (max 4 workers)
- Maintained full performance for local development

### 5. **Environment Variable Priority** âœ…
**Problem:** App was still trying to load credentials from files in production.

**Solution:**
- Updated credential manager to prioritize environment variables in production
- Added detection for Render environment
- Maintained backward compatibility for development

## Files Modified

1. **`gunicorn.conf.py`**
   - Dynamic port binding
   - Cloud-aware worker configuration
   - Enhanced logging

2. **`app.py`**
   - Fixed HealthResponse validation
   - Improved model_info serialization

3. **`Dockerfile`**
   - Removed credential file dependencies
   - Dynamic port in health check
   - Production environment setup

4. **`secure_credential_manager.py`**
   - Prioritized environment variables for cloud deployment
   - Updated help instructions for Render

5. **`mental_wellness_model/config/default.yaml`**
   - Added cloud deployment configuration
   - Documented required environment variables

## Testing Results

âœ… **Import Test:** App module imports successfully  
âœ… **FastAPI Instance:** App creates properly  
âœ… **Dependencies:** All required packages available  
âœ… **Validation Fix:** Health endpoint no longer throws validation errors  

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Push changes to GitHub**
2. **Set environment variables in Render:**
   ```
   GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON={"type":"service_account",...}
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```
3. **Deploy using existing build/start commands:**
   - Build: `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .`
   - Start: `gunicorn --config gunicorn.conf.py app:app`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- âœ… App binds to Render's dynamic PORT
- âœ… Health check returns 200 OK
- âœ… GCS authentication uses environment variables
- âœ… No more 502 Bad Gateway errors
- âœ… Proper startup logging shows port information

## Verification Steps

1. Visit `https://mental-wellness-model.onrender.com/health`
2. Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "...", "model_loaded": true/false}`
3. Check Render logs for: "Mental Wellness API server is ready. Listening on: 0.0.0.0:PORT"
