# ✅ **TRAIN -> GCS -> PREDICT WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION**

## 🎯 **COMPLETED: API Workflow Integration**

Your Mental Wellness API now implements the complete workflow you requested:

**POST /train → Saves model to GCS as "basic_trained_model" → POST /predict loads from GCS**

---

## 🔄 **Implemented Workflow**

### **1. Training Process (`POST /train`)**
```
User calls /train → Model trains → Saves locally → Uploads to GCS as "basic_trained_model" → Returns success
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ Model trains with your data
- ✅ Saves locally as `/app/models/api_trained_model.joblib`
- ✅ **Saves to GCS as `basic_trained_model`** (your requirement)
- ✅ Also saves locally as `/app/models/basic_trained_model.joblib` for immediate use
- ✅ Returns training results and GCS upload status

### **2. Prediction Process (`POST /predict`)**
```
User calls /predict → Loads "basic_trained_model" from GCS → Makes prediction → Returns result
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ **Checks GCS for `basic_trained_model` first** (your requirement)
- ✅ Downloads and loads if found in GCS
- ✅ Falls back to local models if GCS unavailable
- ✅ Makes predictions with loaded model
- ✅ Returns prediction results

---

## 📊 **Code Changes Made**

### **1. Enhanced Training Endpoint**
```python
# NEW: Upload to GCS with standard name "basic_trained_model"
model_name = "basic_trained_model"  # Fixed name as requested
gcs_upload_success = model_state.model_manager.upload_model_to_gcs(
    model_name, 
    {
        "training_request": request.dict(),
        "performance_metrics": results,
        "api_version": "1.0.0",
        "trained_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "model_type": request.model_type
    }
)
```

### **2. Enhanced Model Loading Logic**
```python
# NEW: Look specifically for "basic_trained_model" in GCS first
if "basic_trained_model" in gcs_models:
    logger.info("Found basic_trained_model in GCS, downloading...")
    if self.model_manager.download_model_from_gcs("basic_trained_model"):
        # Load the downloaded model
        self.model_metadata = {
            "source": "gcs_basic_trained_model",
            "gcs_model_name": "basic_trained_model"
        }
```

---

## ✅ **Validation Results**

All tests **PASSED**:

### **Workflow Logic Test**
```
✅ Training saves model with name 'basic_trained_model'
✅ Model loading finds the saved model
✅ Predictions work with loaded model
✅ Batch predictions work correctly
✅ API ModelState logic is sound
```

### **API Integration Test**
```
✅ POST /train → Trains and saves model
✅ POST /predict → Loads model and predicts
✅ Model persists between API calls
✅ Health checks show model status
```

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **Training a Model**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/train \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_type": "random_forest",
    "use_sample_data": true,
    "sample_size": 1000
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Model training completed successfully",
  "model_metadata": {
    "gcs_uploaded": true,
    "gcs_model_name": "basic_trained_model"
  }
}
```

### **Making Predictions**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "age": 35,
    "sleep_hours": 6.5,
    "exercise_minutes": 150,
    "work_stress_level": 7,
    "mood_rating": 6,
    "energy_level": 5,
    "avg_heart_rate": 75,
    "resting_heart_rate": 65
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "depression": {"risk_level": "Moderate Risk", "probability": 0.65},
  "anxiety": {"risk_level": "Low Risk", "probability": 0.23},
  "onset_day": {"predicted_days": 45}
}
```

### **Health Check**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model_loaded": true,
  "model_info": {
    "source": "gcs_basic_trained_model",
    "gcs_model_name": "basic_trained_model"
  }
}
```

---

## 🐳 **Docker Integration**

### **Build and Run**
```bash
docker build -t mental-wellness-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 mental-wellness-api
```

### **What Happens in Container**
1. **Startup**: Checks GCS for `basic_trained_model`
2. **If found**: Downloads and loads from GCS
3. **If not found**: Uses local fallback model
4. **API Ready**: Available for training and predictions

---

## ☁️ **GCS Model Storage**

### **Bucket Structure**
```
mental_wellness_data_lake/
└── Model/
    ├── basic_trained_model.joblib          ← Your model
    ├── basic_trained_model_metadata.json   ← Model info
    └── ...
```

### **Model Lifecycle**
1. **Training**: Model saved to GCS as `basic_trained_model`
2. **Deployment**: Container loads `basic_trained_model` from GCS
3. **Predictions**: Uses the loaded model
4. **Updates**: New training overwrites `basic_trained_model` in GCS

---

## 🔧 **Fallback Strategy**

### **Model Loading Priority**
1. **GCS `basic_trained_model`** ← **PRIMARY (your requirement)**
2. GCS latest model (if basic_trained_model not found)
3. Local production models
4. Local basic_trained_model.joblib (Docker fallback)

### **GCS Unavailable Handling**
- ✅ Training still works (saves locally)
- ✅ Predictions still work (uses local models)
- ✅ No errors or crashes
- ✅ Seamless fallback operation

---

## 🎉 **SUCCESS SUMMARY**

### **Your Requirements ✅ IMPLEMENTED**
- ✅ **POST /train saves model to GCS as "basic_trained_model"**
- ✅ **POST /predict loads "basic_trained_model" from GCS**
- ✅ **Model persistence across Docker deployments**
- ✅ **Seamless cloud storage integration**

### **Additional Benefits**
- ✅ Robust fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Local storage for development
- ✅ Health monitoring endpoints
- ✅ Batch prediction support
- ✅ Docker containerization ready

---

## 🚀 **READY TO USE**

Your API now implements exactly what you requested:

**Training → GCS Storage → Prediction Loading**

The model name `basic_trained_model` is used consistently across:
- GCS storage
- Local fallbacks  
- API responses
- Health checks

**Your workflow is complete and production-ready!** 🎯
